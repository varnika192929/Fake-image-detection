Fake Image Detection Using CNNs and Traditional Image Processing

Overview

Fake image detection is a critical challenge in computer vision and machine learning. This project aims to effectively identify fake images by combining deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with traditional image processing techniques. By extracting key features such as statistical properties, color distributions, and texture information, the system achieves high accuracy and versatility in detecting fake images.
